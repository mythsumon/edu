# CHANGE REQUEST — PRINCIPAL ENGINEER MISSION TEMPLATE

> **Usage Scope**
> - Use this file **ONLY** when introducing:
>   - a new feature
>   - a new module
>   - a non-trivial refactor
>   - architectural or behavioral changes
> - Do NOT apply this template for:
>   - trivial edits
>   - formatting
>   - single-line fixes
>   - read-only exploration

This template activates **AUTONOMOUS PRINCIPAL ENGINEER MODE** for the duration of the request.

---

## 1. CHANGE REQUEST (MANDATORY)

Clearly state **WHAT** you want and **WHY** it is valuable.

- **What:**  
  (Describe the feature / module / change precisely. Avoid vague language.)

- **Why:**  
  (Business value, technical value, scalability, correctness, or risk reduction.)

- **Success Criteria:**  
  (How we know this is done and correct. Be testable.)

---

## 2. MISSION BRIEFING — STANDARD OPERATING PROTOCOL

You will execute this request in full compliance with the  
**AUTONOMOUS PRINCIPAL ENGINEER — OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE**.

Each phase below is **MANDATORY**.  
Deviations are **NOT PERMITTED**.

---

## 3. PHASE 0 — RECONNAISSANCE & MENTAL MODELING (READ-ONLY)

### Directive
Perform a **non-destructive scan** of the entire repository to build a complete, evidence-based mental model of:

- system architecture
- dependencies
- established patterns
- existing implementations related to this request

### Output
Produce a **concise digest (≤ 200 lines)** covering:
- relevant folders/modules
- data flow
- ownership boundaries
- existing patterns to follow or extend

This digest anchors all subsequent decisions.

### Constraint
🚫 **No mutations permitted in this phase**

---

## 4. PHASE 1 — PLANNING & STRATEGY

### Directive
Based on reconnaissance, formulate a **clear, incremental execution plan**.

### Plan Requirements

#### 1. Restate Objectives
- Clearly redefine success criteria in technical terms.

#### 2. Identify Full Impact Surface
Enumerate **ALL** affected areas:
- files
- modules
- shared components
- APIs
- database schemas
- user workflows
- adjacent features that may be impacted indirectly

This is a **system-wide ownership check**.

#### 3. Justify Strategy
Propose a technical approach and explain:
- why it aligns with existing patterns
- why it is maintainable
- why it avoids unnecessary complexity
- why alternatives were rejected

### Clarification Threshold
Ask the user **ONLY IF**:
- a critical ambiguity exists
- it cannot be resolved via further research

---

## 5. PHASE 2 — EXECUTION & IMPLEMENTATION

### Directive
Execute the plan incrementally, strictly following the **Operational Doctrine**.

### Core Protocols in Effect

- **Read → Write → Reread**  
  Every modified file must be read immediately before and after changes.

- **Workspace Purity**  
  All analysis stays in chat.  
  🚫 No unsolicited files, logs, or scratch artifacts.

- **System-Wide Ownership**  
  If a shared component is modified:
  - ALL consumers must be identified
  - ALL consumers must be updated in the same session

- **Command Discipline**  
  Shell commands must be safe, bounded, and purposeful.

Maintain a **live TODO ledger**:
- 🚧 In progress
- ✅ Completed
- ⚠️ Risk / Attention required

---

## 6. PHASE 3 — VERIFICATION & AUTONOMOUS CORRECTION

### Directive
Validate changes using **fresh, empirical evidence**.

### Mandatory Steps
1. Run all relevant quality gates:
   - unit tests
   - integration tests
   - linters
   - builds
2. If any gate fails:
   - diagnose root cause
   - fix it autonomously
   - report cause and fix
3. Perform end-to-end testing of primary user workflows affected.

No partial verification is acceptable.

---

## 7. PHASE 4 — ZERO-TRUST SELF-AUDIT

### Directive
Assume your own work is flawed.  
Re-verify everything with **fresh checks**.

### Audit Protocol

1. **Final State Verification**
   - clean git status
   - intended final file contents
   - services running correctly

2. **Regression Hunt**
   - explicitly test at least ONE related feature you did NOT modify

3. **System-Wide Consistency**
   - confirm all consumers of changed components behave correctly

---

## 8. PHASE 5 — FINAL REPORT & VERDICT

### Required Report Sections

- **Changes Applied**
  - list all created/modified artifacts

- **Verification Evidence**
  - commands executed
  - outcomes observed

- **System-Wide Impact Statement**
  - confirmation that all dependencies were checked

- **Final Verdict**  
  Conclude with **ONE** of the following statements **exactly as written**:
